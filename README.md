## 🌐 What is DOTch_Auction?

**DOTch_Auction** is an on-chain, permissionless Dutch auction protocol built for the **Polkadot ecosystem**. It enables Web3 projects to launch their tokens in a **fair, transparent, and decentralized** way — without whales, bots, or private deals.

The protocol is designed to empower communities by giving everyone equal access to token sales and letting the market naturally discover the fair price.

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional token launches suffer from:
- 🧨 Gas wars, front-running, and unfair allocation
- 🐋 Whales dominating public sales and dumping later
- 🎟️ Private VC deals excluding the community
- 🕵️ Lack of transparency and trust in launch mechanics

---

## ✅ The Solution: DOTch_Auction

DOTch_Auction introduces an **on-chain Dutch auction model** where:

- 📉 Token price starts high and drops over time  
- ⏱️ Users decide when to buy — no rush, no bots  
- 🔍 Everything is **auditable and programmable**  
- 🔒 Permissionless, trustless, and community-friendly  
- 🧱 Built using **Solidity smart contracts **

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. A project creates an auction with:
   - Token amount
   - Start price
   - Minimum price
   - Auction duration
2. The token price decreases **linearly over time** according to the formula:

   **`currentPrice = startPrice - ((startPrice - minPrice) * elapsedTime / duration)`**

   This ensures a smooth and predictable price drop, letting the market naturally find a fair price.


3. Buyers participate by purchasing at the price they find fair
4. The auction ends when either:
- All tokens are sold
- The duration ends
